<p>While chocolate is a beloved and familiar treat for many, the world of <em>craft</em> chocolate, with all its jargon, percentages, and tasting notes, can feel like uncharted territory for even the most passionate chocoholic.</p>

<p><em>What is it? Why is it so expensive? Where on earth do I start? </em></p>

<p>This guide is intended to help you get oriented in this exciting and delicious new world and start you on your own craft chocolate journey. </p>

<h3>What is craft chocolate? </h3>
<p><em>Craft</em> chocolate is chocolate that is made on a small scale, often by hand or in small batches. The term is used to distinguish chocolate made in this way from <em>commercial, </em><em>industrial,</em> or <em>mass-produced</em> chocolate, which is chocolate that has been produced by large companies on a larger scale using industrial machinery. Craft chocolate makers prioritize flavor over volume, and value using high-quality ingredients sourced from ethical producers. They work on the cutting edge of the chocolate industry to demonstrate the possibilities of chocolate and sustainable production.</p>
</div>

<div class="basic">
<h3>What does <em>bean&#8211to&#8211bar</em> mean? </h3>
<p><em>Bean&#8211to&#8211bar</em> chocolate is chocolate that is made using cocoa beans instead of a pre&#8211processed product like cocoa powder or chocolate liquor. Starting with a pre&#8211processed base means much of the flavor development is done before it reaches the chocolate maker. Bean&#8211to&#8211bar makers handle each step of the production process on their own, from roasting the beans to molding the finished product. This gives them fuller control over the flavor profile in the finished chocolate.</p>
<p id="C1"><em>Single&#8211origin</em> means that the bar was made with beans from a single farm instead of a blend of beans from multiple farms. Craft chocolate enthusiasts value single&#8211origin chocolate because it allows you to taste the unique qualities of a specific cocoa bean.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="basic">
<h3>What does the percentage on the package mean?</h3>
<p>The percentage on the package refers to how much of the bar is made from cocoa beans. A bar of <em>70&#37 dark chocolate</em> is 70&#37 cocoa beans and 30&#37 other ingredients, like sugar and cocoa butter. 
If you are used to commercial milk chocolate, a 70&#37 bar may taste quite bitter at first! Try starting with a <em>dark milk</em> or lower-percentage bar and working your way up as your palate adjusts.
</p>
</div>

<div class="basic">
<h3>Why is it so expensive?</h3>
<p id="C3">Craft chocolate is generally more expensive to produce than commercial chocolate. Craft chocolate makers invest a great deal of time and money into sourcing ingredients that are both higher in quality and more ethically produced than the ingredients commonly used in cheaper commercial chocolate. They prioritize paying the farmers they partner with a fair wage and ensuring that the beans are grown and fermented in a way that brings out the best possible flavors. Add to this the increased labor costs of making chocolate by hand in small batches, and you wind up with prices that are higher than many are used to. The sticker shock is understandable, but that high cost goes toward ensuring the highest-quality chocolate and that all people involved in its production are treated fairly.</p>
</div>

<div class="basic">
<h3>Why is ethical sourcing important?</h3>
<p>For such a sweet treat, the chocolate industry has historically had an <a href="https://fairworldproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Issue19-ChocolateUnwrapped-op.jpg">unfortunate dark side.</a> <a href="https://international.nwf.org/cocoa-and-deforestation/">Deforestation,</a> <a href="https://foodispower.org/human-labor-slavery/slavery-chocolate/">slave</a> and <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/our-work/child-forced-labor-trafficking/child-labor-cocoa">child labor,</a> and <a href="https://www.fairtrade.net/news/cocoa-farmers-dont-earn-a-living-income-government-role">unfair farmer compensation</a> are just some of the serious problems that have been rampant in this multi-billion-dollar industry. Ethical sourcing means rejecting these harmful practices. By partnering with ethical farms and paying farmers a fair wage, craft chocolate makers are playing a small role in the shift toward a more ethical future for the chocolate industry.</p></div>

<h3> Where does the flavor come from? </h3>
<p>Much of the chocolateâ€™s flavor potential is related to the variety of cocoa bean used and the environment in which the beans are grown. After the cocoa is harvested, the beans are fermented. This develops the flavor potential, but the beans still taste nothing like chocolate at this stage. They must be roasted and conched (ground and mixed for long periods of time in special machines) to develop their familiar chocolatey flavor. Roasting and conching introduce heat and airflow, allowing makers to eliminate certain unpleasant flavors and aromas, and highlight desirable ones. In the hands of a skilled maker, this careful process can result in a complex and nuanced flavor profile.</p>

<p id="C2">During conching, makers can adjust the heat and airflow to release unpleasant compounds from the cocoa and highlight desirable flavors and aromas. This careful process produces a complex and nuanced flavor profile.</p>

<h3> What origin should I start with? </h3>
<p>One of the most exciting things about exploring craft chocolate is discovering how wildly different cocoa beans from different origins can taste. The following are some recommendations based on common flavor profiles of popular beans from several origins.
