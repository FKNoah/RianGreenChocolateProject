<div class="basic">
<p>While chocolate is a beloved and familiar treat for many, the world of <em>craft</em> chocolate, with all its jargon, percentages, and tasting notes, can feel like uncharted territory for even the most passionate chocoholic. </p>

<p>What is it? Why is it so expensive? Where on earth do I start? </p>

<p>This guide is intended to help you get oriented in this exciting and delicious new world and point you toward a good place to start your own craft chocolate journey. 
</p>

<div class="basic">
<h3>What is &#34;bean-to-bar&#34; chocolate? </h3>
<p>Bean-to-bar chocolate is chocolate that is made using cocoa beans instead of a pre-processed product like cocoa powder or chocolate liquor. Bean-to-bar makers handle each step of the production process on their own, from roasting the beans to molding the finished product. They transform unroasted cocoa beans into delicious chocolate.</p>
</div>

<div class="basic">
<h3 id="C1">What does the percentage on the package mean?</h3>
<p>The percentage on the package refers to how much of the bar is made from cocoa beans. A bar of 70 &#37 dark chocolate is 70 &#37 cocoa beans and 30% other ingredients like sugar and cocoa butter. 
If you are used to eating commercial milk chocolate, a 70 &#37 bar may taste quite bitter at first! Try starting with a &#34dark milk&#34 or lower percentage bar and working your way up as your palate adjusts.
</p>
</div>

<div class="basic">
<h3 id="C2">Why is it so expensive?</h3>
<p>Craft chocolate is generally more expensive to produce than commercial chocolate. Craft chocolate makers invest a great deal of time and money into sourcing ingredients that are both higher in quality and more ethically produced than the ingredients commonly used in cheaper commercial chocolate. They prioritize paying the farmers they partner with a fair wage and ensuring that the beans are grown and fermented in a way that brings out the best possible flavors. Add to this the increased labor costs of making chocolate by hand in small batches, and you wind up with prices that are higher than many are used to. The sticker shock is understandable, but that high cost goes toward ensuring the highest quality chocolate and that all people involved in its production are treated fairly.</p>
</div>

<div class="basic">
<h3 id="C3">Why is ethical sourcing important?</h3>
<p>For such a sweet treat, the chocolate industry has historically had an unfortunate dark side. Habitat destruction, slave and child labor, unfair farmer compensation, and unethical, unsustainable harvesting and labor practices are just some of the serious problems that have been rampant in this multi-billion-dollar industry. Ethical sourcing is important because it helps to discourage these issues. By paying farmers a fair wage and partnering only with farms that enact ethical and sustainable farming and labor practices, craft chocolate makers are one of the driving forces behind the movement to shed light on and eliminate these issues. </p>
</div> 

	  <div class="basic">
<h3 id="C4"> Where does the flavor come from? </h3>
<p>Much of the chocolate’s flavor potential is related to the type of cocoa bean used and the environment in which the beans are grown. After the cacao is harvested, the beans are fermented. This further develops the flavor potential, but at this stage, the beans still taste nothing like chocolate. The beans must be roasted and conched &#40;ground and mixed for long periods of time in special machines)&#41; to develop their familiar chocolatey flavor. During these stages, chocolate makers can eliminate undesirable flavors and highlight desirable ones, producing chocolate with the complex and nuanced flavor profiles that we find in craft chocolate.</p>
</div> 
	  <div class="basic">
<h3 id="C5"> What origin should I start with? </h3>
<p>One of the most exciting things about exploring craft chocolate is discovering how wildly different cocoa beans from different origins can taste. There is incredible flavor diversity in beans from every origin, but knowing what flavors sound good to you can help you figure out where to start.</p>
